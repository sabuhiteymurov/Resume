Hello, my name is Sabuhi Teymurov. I am 23 years old and have experience as a Full Stack Mobile Developer and Front-End Developer. Most recently, I worked as a Front-End Developer at Ferrum Capital where I converted a desktop application to a web app and implemented performance optimizations.

To start off, I am very interested in this Middle Front-End Developer role at DICEUS. I am drawn to your focus on delivering high-quality custom software solutions using agile methodologies. My background aligns well with these priorities.

In past roles, I have successfully collaborated cross-functionally and provided guidance to junior developers. I am comfortable working in an agile environment and have experience implementing user stories, participating in standups, retrospectives and sprint planning.

Some of my key technical skills include React, JavaScript, TypeScript, React Native and testing frameworks like Jest. I am constantly learning and staying up-to-date on front-end best practices and technologies.

I am a self-motivated problem-solver who takes pride in writing clean, well-tested code. Although I have intermediate experience overall, I am confident I can quickly ramp up and contribute as a Middle Front-End Developer here. I am excited by the chance to grow technically while delivering value.
